#       via the interaction X:Z in a mixed-effects model with random intercept
#       for income and fixed time (PY, centered).
#
# Outputs:
#   - results.moderator_screening.income
#
# Notes:
#   - Years restricted to PY >= 2000
#   - Moderator model: y ~ x + z + x:z + PY + (1|group)
#   - Outcome family chosen automatically (Poisson / NegBin / Beta / Gaussian / log-Gaussian)
#   - Multiple testing: BH/FDR across ALL interaction tests per output table

# Optional but recommended for p-values in Gaussian mixed models:
